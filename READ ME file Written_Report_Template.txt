# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Intention is to assist client in determining optimal situation in which to launch a 
kickstarter campaign for the production of a play.   


## Analysis and Challenges

The most significant challenge was pulling meaning out of a significant amount of data.  
The majority of the data pertained to non-theater and non-play items, for instance music 
or artwork.  So, it helped to filter and focus on similar projects to that which the client
has in mind - a play in the theater.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

(I am unable to successfully attach the .PNG file here but that's the intent - please refer to attached file)
It became clear that there is significant seasonality in the theater projects.  While cancelled 
projects are relatively tiny in volume all year, both failed and successful projects have  a relatively 
quiet season from Nov - March and a peak season of activity May through Oct, particularly May and June. 
My recommendation is to aim for spring as the best time for a launch to be planned.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

(I was unable to solve this excercise so I have limited data to evaluate)
Approximately 45% of the successful projects had funding goals below $10,000. Several of the most 
highly funded projects failed.  My recommendation is to try to keep the funding objectives at 
the lower end of the spectrum, if possible, below $10,000 or $15,000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

My lack of Excel skills and function error problem solving was by far the most significant issue I dealt 
with through this process.  And lack of planning far in advance to address with the resources available to us.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	*Schedule for the Spring
	*Keep costs and necessary funding low and simple
	

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	*Having lavish budgets does not appear to be a guarantee for success
	*Quite a lot of the successful projects were at the extreme low end of the budget spectrum
	

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	Size, although it can be filtered very successfully as the data is clean
	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I'd love to evaluate across Parent Categories and other Subcategories too, becoming familiar with 
other types of industries and projects
